# R-Studio-Scripts
This contains a few files each outlining commonly used statistics packages with an example and commented code on how to use it. 

There is a file with my commonly used code for data cleaning and my general markdown file set up. 

Lastly, there is a file with examples of syntax differences between R and Python for when I've been in Python too much too recently.
